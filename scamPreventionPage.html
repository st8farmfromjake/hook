                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Make sure that the email address is trustworthy,

                    <ul>
                        <li>Check for obviously fake or scam email addresses “gogle@gogle.org”</li>
                        <li>Make sure its someone from the company, but also not an impersonator</li>
                        <li>Check for any misspellings in the address as well</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Don't click on <b>ANY</b> links from untrustworthy senders
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Look into the link directly <b>before</b> clicking on the links</li>
                        <li><a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search?hl=en" target="_blank">Here</a> is the official Google Safe Browser checker that checks the URLs of website without you having to open them yourself</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If the Email looks suspicious ask your trusted IT team
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Don't be afraid to ask your IT team, it’s better to take up seconds of their time than to risk leaking data!</li>
                    </ul>
